# Pentest Workflow

Script for automating the active reconnaissance phase during penetration tests.

## Installation

In order to use the script easily it is recommended to add the path to the repository in your `$PATH`.

## Usage

The script requires running it with `sudo` privileges in order to use the full features of tools like `nmap` and `masscan`.

## Functionality

The script can perform different reconnaissance types depending on the user's needs:

* Host discovery and full network scan via `nmap`: This feature consists in performing an initial `ping scan` in order to determine live host on a network, and then perform a full scan on each of the live hosts on the network. The results are saved into two separate directories:
  * nmap_icmp_probe_dir
  * nmap_full_scan

* Host and open ports discovery with `masscan`. Useful for performing fast scans and determining the status of the most common open ports. Results are saved in `xml` format.

* HTTP discovery and basic vulnerability scanning. Useful for scanning for low hanging http vulnerabilities and bruteforcing web server directories and files. Done through the use of three tools:
  * Gobuster
  * Nikto
  * WhatWeb

* Offline exploit searches with `searchsploit` for the versions of services determined from the initial nmap scan. Takes as input the directory with the nmap full scan results and saves the results in `searchsploit_output`.
